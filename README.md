# The fastai book

These notebooks cover an introduction to deep learning, fastai, and PyTorch. They are copyright Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger, 2020 onwards. The code in the notebooks and python `.py` files is covered by the GPL v3 license; see the LICENSE file for details.

The remainder (including all markdown cells in the notebooks and other prose) is not licensed for any redistribution or change of format or medium, other than making copies of the notebooks or forking this repo for your own private use. No commercial or broadcast use is allowed.

This is an early draft. We will be providing a channel for comments and feedback soon.
